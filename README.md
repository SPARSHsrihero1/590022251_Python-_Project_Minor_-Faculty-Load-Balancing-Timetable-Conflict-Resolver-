Faculty Load Balancing & Timetable Conflict Resolver
📌 Overview

In colleges, faculty timetables are usually managed manually, which often leads to schedule clashes, uneven workload distribution, and frequent class rescheduling. As students, we experience these issues regularly through cancelled or shifted classes.
This project is a simple Python-based solution that analyzes faculty timetables, detects conflicts, calculates teaching workload, and suggests better workload distribution.

🎯 Problem Statement

Faculty members may end up with overlapping classes, back-to-back lectures, or excessive weekly teaching hours. At the same time, some faculty may be underutilized. These imbalances affect teaching quality and disrupt students’ academic schedules.

✅ Objectives

Detect timetable clashes for faculty

Calculate weekly teaching workload

Identify overloaded and underloaded faculty

Suggest rule-based redistribution of classes

Generate a readable report for reference

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python

Concepts Used:

Lists and Dictionaries

Functions

Loops and Conditional Statements

File Handling

Basic Exception Handling

⚙️ How the Project Works

Faculty timetable details are entered into the system

The program checks for overlapping time slots

Weekly teaching hours are calculated for each faculty

Faculty workload is compared with predefined limits

Suggestions are generated to balance the workload

A report is saved to a file
